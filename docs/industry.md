# Guidance for Sharing App or Registry Data with Clinical Trial Sponsors

---
!!! important "Disclaimer"
    This document provides general guidance and is not legal advice.  
    Legal, regulatory, and ethics experts should be consulted before implementing data-sharing practices.

---
## 1. Purpose

This document establishes a policy for the responsible sharing of **patient-generated data (PGD)** collected through a patient advocacy group's tracker application or patient registry. It is intended to protect:

- Clinical trial integrity
- Patient privacy and informed consent
- Ethical and regulatory compliance
- Scientific credibility

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- The patient tracker app or registry operated by the advocacy group
- Any biopharmaceutical company (“Sponsor”), including those:
    - Conducting ongoing clinical trials
    - Planning future trials

It governs sharing of:

- Aggregate and individual-level data
- Historical and contemporaneous datasets
- Scientific, commercial, and regulatory uses of patient-generated data

---
## 3. Regulatory Background: Key Guidance

This section summarizes official FDA and EMA guidance, and concrete regulatory precedents, that are relevant to sharing patient-generated data (PGD) with clinical trial sponsors.

### 3.1 FDA – Real-World Data and Real-World Evidence (2023)

**Guidance:**  
“Considerations for the Use of Real-World Data and Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products” (Guidance for Industry, Aug 2023).

- [FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/171667/download)

**Key points and quotes:**

- Sponsors are expected to have a **prospectively defined protocol and SAP** for any RWD study that will support a marketing application.

- The guidance states:  
  > “Sponsors should provide draft versions of their proposed protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) for Agency review and comment…”

- FDA emphasizes that it must be confident that data sources and analyses were **not selected to favor a particular conclusion**. This is why informal, ad hoc use of external data streams is viewed skeptically.

### 3.2 FDA – Real-World Data: Assessing Registries (Dec 2023)

**Guidance:**  
“Real-World Data: Assessing Registries to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products” (Guidance for Industry, Dec 2023).

- [FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/154449/download)

**Key points and quotes:**

- Registries are defined as systems that enroll a **predefined population** and collect **prespecified** health-related data.

- The guidance notes:  
  > “Establishing registries involves enrolling a predefined population and collecting prespecified health-related data for each patient in that population.”

- For regulatory use, sponsors are responsible for ensuring the registry supports **relevant and reliable** data.

- The guidance also states:  
  > “Sponsors should… submit the protocols and statistical analysis plans to the Agency before conducting the study.”

Together, these guidance documents establish that regulatory-grade RWD/RWE must be **pre-planned, protocol-driven, and governed**, not ad hoc.

### 3.3 EMA – Computerised Systems and Electronic Data in Clinical Trials (2023)

**Guideline:**  
“Guideline on Computerised Systems and Electronic Data in Clinical Trials” (EMA/INS/GCP/112288/2023).

- [EMA Guideline](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/guideline-computerised-systems-and-electronic-data-clinical-trials_en.pdf)

**Key points and quotes:**

- The guideline sets expectations for **validated, controlled computerised systems** used for trial data, including ePRO, wearables, EHR, and other electronic sources.

- It explains that it:  
  > “…covers requirements and expectations for computerised systems, including validation, user management, security, and electronic data for the data life cycle.”

- The underlying goal is that all clinical-trial data used in decision-making are **traceable, auditable and under sponsor or investigator control**.

Unplanned importing of external app data into a trial context sits uncomfortably with these expectations.

<!--
### 3.4 EMA – Reflection on External Controls and RWD

**Program:**  
“Development of a reflection paper on the use of external controls in evidence generation and regulatory decision-making.”

- [EMA page](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/development-reflection-paper-use-external-controls-evidence-generation-regulatory-decision-making-scientific-guideline)

The reflection work emphasizes that external controls and RWD must be used under **prospectively planned, well-governed designs** to avoid bias. External data that are not pre-specified or quality-controlled are considered high-risk for decision-making.
### 3.5 Regulatory Precedent: External Controls Not Accepted

Publicly available FDA reviews and secondary analyses show multiple cases where RWD-based external controls were **not accepted** as adequate for regulatory decision-making, mainly due to methodological flaws and lack of pre-specified design.

#### Rozlytrek (entrectinib) – ROS1-positive NSCLC

- External control arm built from Flatiron Health RWD to compare with single-arm trials.
- FDA’s Division of Epidemiology concluded the RWD cohort was **not comparable** to the trial population and that the study:  
  > “is not adequate to allow a robust comparison of treatment outcomes between crizotinib and entrectinib study arms.”

- FDA also advised that future RWD studies should be based on an **a priori** (prospectively defined) protocol, and viewed the current analysis as post-hoc.

Key documents:

- [FDA RWD review](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2019/212725Orig1s000%2C%20212726Orig1s000OtherR.pdf)

- [Case summary](https://evidence-hub.aetion.com/learnings-from-three-fda-decisions-on-eca-submissions-in-oncology)

#### Xpovio (selinexor) – Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma

- RWD external control from Flatiron was submitted to contextualize overall survival.
- FDA stated that:  
  > “The evidence generated from the RWD analysis is not adequate to provide context or comparison for the overall survival observed in the [clinical trial] patients.”

- Reasons included **lack of comparability** and multiple biases (selection, confounding, immortal time, missing data).

Key documents:

- [FDA review](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2019/212306Orig1s000MultidisciplineR.pdf)

- Case summary: same Aetion article as above.

#### Balversa (erdafitinib) – FGFR-mutant Bladder Cancer

- RWD external control was submitted for overall survival.
- FDA’s epidemiology reviewers concluded:  
  > “DEPI [did] not consider the study sufficiently valid for supporting regulatory decisions pertaining to drug effectiveness…”

- Methodological issues included confounding, selection bias, data missingness, temporal bias, and limited sample size.

### 3.6 Implication for Patient-Advocacy Group 

These guidance documents and precedents collectively support the view that:

- **Non-prospectively-defined access to external data** (such as contemporaneous patient-tracker data) is **not aligned** with regulatory expectations.
- Regulators expect RWD used in decisions to be gathered under **pre-specified protocols and SAPs**, in **validated, controlled systems**, and free from ad hoc “data peeking.”
- Even if the sponsor does **not intend** to use the tracker data directly in a submission, access to such data can still create concerns about **biasing trial conduct or interpretation**.

## 4. Key Principles

### 4.1 Prospective Planning

All data sources and intended uses must be predefined. Non-prospectively planned data sharing is discouraged.

### 4.2 Protection of Clinical Trial Integrity

PGD must not:

- Unblind or risk unblinding
- Provide informal interim signals
- Influence trial conduct
- Circumvent DSMB/IDMC processes

### 4.3 Consent & Privacy

- Sharing must align with the tracker app’s consent
- De-identification must meet relevant regulatory standards
- Re-identification risk must be assessed

### 4.4 Data Governance

Requires:

- A Data Use Agreement (DUA)
- Documented sponsor firewalls

### 4.5 Transparency

Patients should understand potential data-sharing practices.

---

## 5. When Data Sharing Is Permissible

### 5.1 De-Identified or Anonymized Data

- Meets HIPAA/GDPR standards
- Re-identification risk assessed

### 5.2 Limited Impact on Trials

- Historical (non-contemporaneous)
- Aggregated
- Cannot reveal efficacy or safety trends

### 5.3 Governance and Firewalls

- DUA in place
- Access limited to RWE teams
- Trial teams excluded

### 5.4 Clear, Pre-Specified Use

Examples:

- Natural history studies
- Burden-of-illness projects
- HEOR
- Non-regulatory scientific uses

### 5.5 Ethics Oversight

Recommended for small rare-disease populations.

---

## 6. When Data Sharing Is Not Permissible

High-risk scenarios:

- Contemporaneous patient-level symptom data
- Data revealing efficacy/safety trends
- Likely overlap with trial participants
- Inadequate consent
- No DUA or governance
- Ad hoc exploratory sponsor requests
- Any sharing that could bias trial conduct

**Important:** The issue exists even if the sponsor does **not** intend to use the data in a regulatory submission. Regulators assess whether access *could have influenced* the trial.
