# Data Use Agreements (DUA) & Data Access

*This page outlines how to request access to the registry data and the terms for using the data.* Transparency about data use policies helps researchers understand the requirements before they attempt to obtain the data.

**How to Request Data:** Interested researchers should [describe the process – e.g., "contact the registry coordinator at XYZ email", or "fill out the data request form (link)"]. Include any prerequisites (for example, *must be affiliated with an institution*, or *provide a research plan*).

**Data Use Agreement:** Before accessing the data, researchers will need to sign a Data Use Agreement. This agreement ensures that:
- The data will only be used for the approved research purpose.
- No attempts will be made to re-identify individual participants.
- Data will be stored securely and not shared further without permission.
- [Any other conditions specific to your registry].

You can download a template DUA [provide link if available] or request one via email. The DUA must be reviewed and co-signed by an authorized official at the researcher’s institution.

**Citation and Acknowledgement:** If you use the registry data in a publication or presentation, you are expected to acknowledge the data source. For example: *“Data were provided by the [Registry Name], with appropriate IRB approval and data use agreements.”* Check if the registry has specific language for acknowledgments or if you should credit a funding source.

**Contact for Data Access:** [Name, role] – [email address]. (This is the person or office to reach out to for initiating data access requests or for any questions regarding the DUA.)

*Instructions:* Tailor the instructions above to your registry’s policies. Make sure it’s clear what steps a potential data user should take, and what rules they must agree to. If your registry does not share data publicly at all, use this section to clarify the reasons or the process for internal use only.
