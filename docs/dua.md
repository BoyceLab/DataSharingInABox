# Data Use Agreements (DUA) & Data Access

*This page outlines how to request access to the registry data and the terms for using the data.* Transparency about data use policies helps researchers understand the requirements before they attempt to obtain the data.

## How to Request Data

Interested researchers should [describe the process – e.g., "contact the registry coordinator at your@email.org", or "fill out the data request form (link)"].
Include any prerequisites (for example, *must be affiliated with an institution*, or *provide a research plan*).

_For a complete overview, see [Information for Researchers](researchers.md)._

## Data Use Agreement (DUA)

Before accessing the data, researchers will need to sign a Data Use Agreement. This agreement ensures that:

- The data will only be used for the approved research purpose.
- No attempts will be made to re-identify individual participants.
- Data will be stored securely and not shared further without permission.
- [Add any other conditions specific to your registry here.]

You can download a template DUA [provide link if available] or request one via email. The DUA must be reviewed and co-signed by an authorized official at the researcher’s institution.

## Citation and Acknowledgement

If you use the registry data in a publication or presentation, you are expected to acknowledge the data source. For example:

*“Data were provided by the [Registry Name], with appropriate IRB approval and data use agreements.”*

Check if your registry has specific language for acknowledgments or if you are required to credit a funding source.
