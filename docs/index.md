# Welcome to Your Patient Registry Data Sharing Ecosystem Template

This open-source template is designed to help organizations with patient registries create a professional, public-facing website that shares information about your data, governance, and access procedures.

It’s built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and is intended to make it easier for your team to support transparent and responsible data sharing.

## 🌟 What You’ll Find Here

This site template includes pre-structured pages and suggested content such as:

- A **Data Dictionary** page to describe variables available to researchers
- A **Derived Fields** section for calculated variables or harmonized fields

- An **IRB Documentation** page to describe ethics and regulatory oversight
- Sample **FAQs**, **Acknowledgments**, and links to key policy resources
- A growing **Key Resources** section for federal and international guidance

## 🛠️ Built for Customization

This template is fully editable and modular. Your team can:

- Replace placeholder text with your own registry content
- Add or remove pages from the navigation
- Upload your organization’s logo and adjust colors or layout
- Host the site publicly with GitHub Pages or another provider

Not technical? No problem. The [How to Customize This Template](customization.md) page walks you through each step with clear instructions.
