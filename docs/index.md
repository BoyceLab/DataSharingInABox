# Welcome to Your Patient Registry Data Sharing Ecosystem Template

This open-source website template is designed to help patient registry teams create a professional, public-facing portal for sharing information about their data, governance policies, and access procedures.

Built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, this site supports transparent, ethical, and well-documented data sharing — even if your team has limited technical resources.

## 🌟 What’s Included

The template comes with pre-built pages and sample language for:

- A **Data Dictionary** outlining available variables
- **Derived Fields** describing calculated or harmonized data
- **Information for Researchers**, including DUA & access instructions
- **IRB Documentation** explaining ethical oversight
- Sample **FAQs**, **Acknowledgments**, and policy references
- A curated **Key Resources** page for external guidance and learning

## 🧪 Potential Use Cases for Shared Registry Data

This section helps you explain how your registry data can support meaningful research, translational science, and clinical discovery. Example use cases:

### Academic Research
- Analyze disease progression or treatment patterns
- Explore demographic or clinical subgroup trends
- Conduct retrospective observational studies
- Correlate clinical data with **biospecimen-based phenotyping**
- Integrate registry data with **genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic** analyses

### Clinical & Quality Benchmarking
- Compare outcomes across sites or networks
- Identify variation in care delivery
- Generate insights to inform care improvement initiatives

### Industry Collaboration
- Design trials with real-world inclusion and exclusion criteria
- Discover unmet clinical or diagnostic needs
- Use real-world data to identify biomarkers or stratify patient populations

### Public Health & Policy
- Estimate disease prevalence or geographic distribution
- Model healthcare utilization or economic burden
- Inform guideline development or public health strategies

> ✨ Your team can edit or expand this list to reflect your registry’s goals.

## 🛠️ Built for Customization

You can fully adapt the site to match your registry:

- Swap in your own content and structure
- Update branding and page layout
- Add new tabs or link to external sites
- Publish via GitHub Pages or other hosting platforms
