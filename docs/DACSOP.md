# Standard Operating Procedures  
## Data Access Committee (DAC)

---

## 1. Introduction

The Data Access Committee (DAC) is established to review, assess, and decide on third-party
requests for access to data held within a registry or data repository (“the Registry”).
The DAC ensures that access to Registry data is granted in accordance with established
policies, ethical principles, and applicable data protection regulations.

Different levels of data access authorization—based on the type of data requested, the
nature of the requestor, and the intended purpose of use—are defined in the Registry’s
Data Access Policy (DAP).

This document describes the operating procedures of the DAC to promote transparency,
consistency, accountability, and compliance.

## 2. Composition of the DAC

### 2.1 DAC Co-Chairs

- The DAC is led by two Co-Chairs appointed by the Registry’s governing or steering body.
- The Co-Chairs provide strategic oversight and ensure that DAC decisions align with the
  mission and objectives of the Registry.
- Co-Chairs may represent complementary perspectives (e.g. scientific, clinical, or
  participant/community representation).

### 2.2 DAC Members

The DAC is composed of members with expertise relevant to the Registry, which may include:

- A representative of Registry data contributors or participating sites
- A subject-matter or domain expert relevant to the data access request
- A patient, public, or community representative, where applicable

Membership may be adapted depending on the scope and nature of individual requests.

### 2.3 DAC Secretariat

- The DAC is supported by a Secretariat responsible for coordinating DAC activities,
  managing communications, and maintaining records.
- The Secretariat serves as the primary point of contact for data requestors.

### 2.4 Rotation and Review

- DAC membership may follow a rotation system to ensure continuity, availability, and
  appropriate representation.
- The composition and leadership of the DAC are reviewed at least every three years,
  or earlier if required.

### 2.5 Ad Hoc Expertise

- The DAC may seek additional expertise on an ad hoc basis to support the evaluation of
  specific requests.
- This may include scientific, technical, ethical, legal, or data protection expertise.

- Verifying that requestors are appropriately qualified and authorized
- Confirming that required ethical, institutional, or regulatory approvals are in place

## 4. Data Access Request Process

1. **Submission**  
   Data requestors submit a completed Data Access Request Form for each proposed project.

2. **Administrative Review**  
   The DAC Secretariat performs an initial review to confirm completeness and eligibility.
   Clarifications or additional information may be requested.

3. **DAC Review**  
   Complete requests are submitted to the DAC for evaluation. The DAC may request further
   clarification from the applicant.

4. **Decision and Feedback**  
   The DAC approves, conditionally approves, or rejects the request and provides written
   feedback outlining any conditions or recommendations.

5. **Data Use Agreement**  
   Prior to any data transfer or access, approved requestors must sign a Data Transfer
   Agreement (DTA) or Data Use Agreement specifying permitted uses, restrictions, and
   data protection obligations.

## 5. Meetings and Decision-Making

- The DAC meets at regular or ad hoc intervals depending on the volume and urgency of
  requests.
- The Secretariat circulates relevant documentation in advance of meetings.
- The DAC Co-Chairs chair meetings and facilitate discussions.
- In the absence of one Co-Chair, the other assumes full responsibility.
- Decisions are made by consensus where possible; otherwise, voting procedures defined
  by the DAC apply.
- Each DAC member typically has one vote.
- All decisions, including declared conflicts of interest, are documented by the Secretariat.

---

## 6. Conflicts of Interest

- DAC members must declare any actual or perceived conflicts of interest related to a
  specific data access request.
- Non-conflicted members determine whether recusal is required.
- Recused members do not participate in discussions or decisions and do not access
  related confidential materials.

---

## 7. Confidentiality and Data Security

- DAC members must maintain confidentiality regarding data access requests and
  deliberations.
- All documents are stored and managed using secure systems.
- Data access is restricted to authorized parties in accordance with approved procedures
