# Understanding NIH Data Sharing Language in Registry Agreements

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> This page provides a general explanation of NIH data sharing expectations, particularly as they apply to patient registries. It is **not legal or regulatory advice**. Please consult your institution’s **IRB or regulatory officials** to determine how these policies apply to your specific registry and data governance practices.

## The inclusion of NIH Data Sharing language in data use agreements is essential for ensuring compliance with federal policy, protecting patient privacy, and supporting responsible scientific research.

This page outlines why such language is important, what it requires of investigators, and how it applies specifically to patient registries such as those managed by **[Registry Owner/Organization]**.

## 1. NIH DMS Policy Applies to All NIH-Funded Research

As of **January 25, 2023**, the NIH requires all funded research to include a Data Management & Sharing (DMS) Plan.

🔗 [NIH Data Sharing Portal](https://sharing.nih.gov)

### Researchers Must:

- Plan how scientific data will be managed and shared
- Specify data types, repositories, formats, access levels, and timelines
- Follow their DMS Plan as a condition of funding
- Justify any restrictions or limits on sharing

If registry data are included, your DMS Plan must not violate privacy protections or registry policies.

## 2. Registry Data Often Cannot Be Openly Shared

Even when de-identified, patient registry data may pose re-identification risks due to:

- Rare or small populations
- Geographic/demographic uniqueness
- Traceability through center affiliation

Typically, consent forms **do not permit public sharing** of record-level data. Instead, data must be shared via **controlled access mechanisms**.

NIH recognizes that legal or ethical concerns may limit sharing:

## 3. NIH Projects Must Coordinate with the Registry

If a research project involves NIH funding:

- Notify the registry team (e.g., **[datarequests@yourorg.org]**)
- Coordinate any changes requested by NIH reviewers
- Allow the registry to supply appropriate documentation

This protects all parties and ensures NIH, HIPAA, and registry policies align.

## 4. Journals Expect Data Sharing—But Not Public Posting

Journals and funders now ask for:

- Data availability statements
- Clear access pathways for other researchers

❌ Do **not** post registry data on:
  - GitHub
  - Kaggle
  - Dryad
  - Figshare
  - Supplemental materials in manuscripts
  
Without checking with your Institutional Review Board first!

✅ Instead, use NIH-compatible controlled access language:

> “Data may be available from [Registry Organization] upon request and contingent on approval by the [Registry Oversight Committee]. Access restrictions are in place to protect participant privacy.”

## 5. Why This Is Important to Understand

| Benefit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🛡️ Protects Patients | Prevents accidental re-identification |
| ✅ Complies with NIH | Meets DMS Plan expectations |
| 🧭 Clarifies Roles | The registry owner is the gatekeeper, not the external PI |
| 🧠 Avoids Mistakes | Prevents premature or inappropriate data sharing |
| 🤝 Builds Trust | Maintains public confidence in research participation |
