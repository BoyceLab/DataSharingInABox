# Information for Researchers

This page explains how to request access to data from the patient registry and outlines key steps in the data use process.

## 🧾 Data Use Agreement & Ethics

Before data access can be granted, all investigators must:

- Review and agree to the [Data Use Agreement](dua.md)
- Provide proof of IRB or ethics board approval
- Submit a complete data access application

> ⚠️ *Registries are encouraged to work with their IRB and legal teams to ensure that their Data Use Agreement reflects their governance model, privacy protections, and any regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).*
