# Information for Researchers

This page explains how to request access to data from the patient registry and outlines key steps in the data use process.

## 🧾 Data Use Agreement & Ethics

Before data access can be granted, all investigators must:

- Review and agree to the [Data Use Agreement](dua.md)
- Provide proof of IRB or ethics board approval
- Submit a complete data access application

> ⚠️ *Registries are encouraged to work with their IRB and legal teams to ensure that their Data Use Agreement reflects their governance model, privacy protections, and any regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).*

## 📋 What to Submit

A complete data access request typically includes:

- A brief research proposal or study aims  
- A list of requested data elements or cohorts  
- IRB/ethics approval letter  
- Signed Data Use Agreement  
- Timeline and any expected funding source  
- Named collaborators and data security plans  

> 💡 *Registries may include a downloadable submission template or link to an online data access portal.*

---

## 🛡️ Oversight and Review

All data requests are evaluated by the **Data Access Committee (DAC)** to ensure:

- Scientific merit and feasibility  
- Compliance with ethical standards  
- Appropriate use of sensitive or identifiable fields  
- Data use aligns with the registry's goals and participant consent

We have created a sample Data Access Committee (DAC) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) [here](./DACSOP.md) and [DAC evaluation rubric, [here](./DACrubric.md).

## 🧨 After Approval

Once your application is approved:

- You’ll receive a copy of the finalized DUA  
- The registry team will coordinate access or data delivery  
- You may be asked to provide periodic updates or reports  
- Destruction of data may be required after study completion
