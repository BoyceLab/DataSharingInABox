# Data Access Request Evaluation Rubric  
## For Use by the Data Access Committee (DAC)

---

## Purpose

This rubric supports consistent, transparent, and proportionate evaluation of data
access requests. It is intended for use by DAC members when reviewing applications
for access to registry or repository data.

The rubric may be adapted to local legal, ethical, and operational requirements.

---

## How to Use This Rubric

- Each criterion should be assessed independently.
- Criteria may be scored qualitatively or numerically, depending on DAC practice.
- Not all criteria carry equal weight; higher scrutiny should be applied to requests
  involving more sensitive data or higher risk.
- The DAC may approve, conditionally approve, or reject a request based on the
  overall assessment.
